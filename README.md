This a project which consists of three components i.e. Interactive dashboard in Excel and Tableu with EDA cum prediction using Python in jupyter notebook
For prediction I have used regression model named linear regression
In the EDA process I have plotted many graphs like line,scatter,box,count plots etc
Also created pairplot and Heatmap
Libraries used are NUMPY,PANDAS,MATPLOTLIB,SEABORN,SKLEARN,PCA etc
The Entire process is shown in the pdf IMDB_Top_1000.pdf
